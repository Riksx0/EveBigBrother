CONFIGURE your PC TO USE THE PROGRAM:

Install "tesseract-ocr-w64-setup-5.3.3.20231005" that the folder includes, INSTALL IT AND THEN COPY THEP PATH WHERE YOU INSTALLED IT (it should be something like "C:\Program Files\Tesseract-OCR"), once installed, go to "Edit the system enviroment variables" on your pc, (press Windows Key, then search edit system enviroment, you'll see it, it will open a System Properties window) then press "Enviroment variables..." at the bottom, press "Path" (there are 2 Path, one in user variables and another one in system Click the System one) and then  "Edit..." at the bottom, it will pop up a window where you'll press "New" and paste the path that you copied at the start (something like something like "C:\Program Files\Tesseract-OCR") click accept, accept, accept and follow the next instructions.

CONFIGURE THE PROGRAM:

1. configure the devies.txt, for this you need the ADB port of the current emulator, this is something like 127.0.0.1:16480, so in this TXT you need to write the system of the emulator and the port, like this  "Jita 127.0.0.1:16480" if you dont know where to get the port contact me in discord.

2. configure the discord webhook, you need to create a webhook on the channel where you want to send the intel, just copy the webhook and paste it on the TXT.

3. MAKE SURE YOU HAVE THE RIGHT RESOLUTION, set it to Mobile mode and 540x960.
