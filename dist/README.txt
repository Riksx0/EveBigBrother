!!!!!!! HOW TO USE IT: !!!!!!!


CONFIGURE THE PROGRAM:

1. Open the .exe
2. Click Config
3. put your Width and Height of your screen (if its 1920x1080 put 1920 on width and 1080 on height)
4. create a webhook in discord on the channel where you want the intel to be sent (if you dont know how to create a webhook ask me in discord, i can help you)
5. copy the webhook URL
6. paste it on the webhook URL on config window
7. once everything is done, click accept and follow next instructions.

START USING THE PROGRAM:

1. add a region and put a random name.
2. click start monitoring.
3. click stop monitoring.
4. delete the region.
^^^^ THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT ^^^^

5. add a new region and now put the correct name (usually the system where the camera is and the gate that is looking at, for example (SD- gate to JU-)
6. click start monitoring.
--- if you want to stop it monitoring, then click stop.

%%% IMPORTANT %%%

BEFORE YOU DELETE A REGION YOU MUST STOP IT MONITORING, OTHERWISE IT WILL KEEP MONITORING AFTER ITS DELETED, ALSO STOP MONITORING ALL BEFORE YOU CLOSE THE PROGRAM (this will get fixed)

%%% IMPORTANT %%%

repeat step 4 for evey region (system) that want to be monitored.

-----
REMEMBER THAT THIS PROGRAM ONLY CHECK THE OVERVIEW CHANGES (at the moment) SO YOU NEED TO HAVE A SPECIAL OVERVIEW WHERE ONLY REDS/GREY APPEAR.
-----




(there is a bug on the window where you select the region name and delay, just adjust it a bit down and the OK button will appear, sorry for this it will be fixed as soon as possible (im rly busy irl))
